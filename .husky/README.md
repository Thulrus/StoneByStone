# Git Hooks Directory

This directory contains Git hooks managed by [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/).

## What's Here

- `pre-commit` - Runs before each commit to ensure code quality

## How It Works

Husky automatically sets up these hooks when you run `npm install`.

## Modifying Hooks

Edit the files in this directory to change what runs at each Git event.

## More Info

See [docs/PRE_COMMIT_SETUP.md](../docs/PRE_COMMIT_SETUP.md) for full documentation.
