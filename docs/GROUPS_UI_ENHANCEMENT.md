# Groups UI Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Enhanced the groups feature with a comprehensive UI overhaul, including tabbed navigation, group highlighting on the map, and quick navigation to grave locations.

## Implementation Date

October 6, 2025

## New Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Tabbed List Sidebar

**Component**: `TabbedList.tsx`

The sidebar now has two tabs:

- **Graves Tab** (default): Shows the existing grave list
- **Groups Tab**: Shows the new group list

**Features**:

- Tab switching preserves selected state
- Displays item counts for each tab
- Active tab highlighted with blue accent
- Smooth transitions between tabs

### 2. ✅ Group List Component

**Component**: `GroupList.tsx`

A dedicated component for browsing and managing groups:

**Features**:

- Search bar (searches name and description)
- Sort options:
  - By name (alphabetical)
  - By member count
- Ascending/descending toggle
- Visual color indicators for each group
- Member count display
- Click to select and highlight

**Display**:

- Group name with color badge
- Description (if provided)
- Member count
- Selected group has blue border and background

### 3. ✅ Group Member Highlighting

When a group is selected from the Groups tab:

- All members of that group are highlighted on the map
- Uses the existing `highlightedGraves` Set mechanism
- Visual feedback with gold/yellow border on map
- Persists until another group is selected or cleared

**Implementation**:

- `handleGroupSelection` in `CemeteryView.tsx`
- Queries `getGravesByGroupId()` from IndexedDB
- Sets highlighted graves Set
- MapGrid automatically renders highlighted state

### 4. ✅ "Go To Location" Button

**Component**: Enhanced `ElementInfoModal.tsx`

Added a new button in the info modal for graves, landmarks, and roads:

**Button Features**:

- Green button with 📍 pin icon
- Label: "Go To Location"
- Positioned before "Edit" button
- Available for all element types

**Functionality**:

- Closes the info modal
- Centers the map on the element's location
- For graves: also highlights the grave for 3 seconds
- For roads: centers on first cell
- Smooth panning to center position

**Implementation**:

- New `centerOn(row, col)` method in `MapGridRef`
- `handleGoToLocation` in `CemeteryView.tsx`
- Calculates center position based on element type
- Temporary highlight with auto-clear timer

### 5. ✅ Map Centering API

**Component**: Enhanced `MapGrid.tsx`

Added new `centerOn` method to `MapGridRef`:

```typescript
centerOn: (row: number, col: number) => void
```

**How it works**:

1. Calculates cell center in SVG coordinates
2. Gets container viewport dimensions
3. Computes transform to center the cell
4. Applies transform while preserving current zoom

**Math**:

```
cellCenter = (col * CELL_SIZE + CELL_SIZE / 2, row * CELL_SIZE + CELL_SIZE / 2)
transform.x = containerCenterX - cellCenterX * scale
transform.y = containerCenterY - cellCenterY * scale
```

## Files Created

### New Components

- `src/components/GroupList.tsx` - Group browsing component
- `src/components/TabbedList.tsx` - Tabbed sidebar wrapper

## Files Modified

### Components

- `src/components/MapGrid.tsx`
  - Added `centerOn` method to `MapGridRef`
  - Enables programmatic map centering

- `src/components/ElementInfoModal.tsx`
  - Added `onGoToLocation` prop
  - Added "Go To Location" button
  - Button conditionally rendered if callback provided

### Pages

- `src/pages/CemeteryView.tsx`
  - Replaced `GraveList` with `TabbedList`
  - Added group selection state
  - Added `groupMemberCounts` memoized calculation
  - Added `handleGroupSelection` callback
  - Added `handleGoToLocation` callback
  - Integrated all new components

### Library

- `src/lib/idb.ts`
  - Already had `getGravesByGroupId` function
  - No changes needed (used by new features)

## User Workflow

### Browsing Groups

1. Open cemetery view
2. Click "Groups" tab in sidebar
3. See list of all groups with:
   - Color indicators
   - Descriptions
   - Member counts
4. Use search to filter groups
5. Use sort dropdown to order by name or size
6. Click on a group to select it

### Viewing Group Members

1. Select a group from Groups tab
2. All member graves are highlighted on map (gold border)
3. Visual indication of group membership
4. Navigate back to Graves tab to see individual members

### Quick Navigation to Graves

1. View any grave's information (click on map or from list)
2. Click "📍 Go To Location" button
3. Modal closes
4. Map automatically pans and centers on the grave
5. Grave is highlighted for 3 seconds
6. Perfect for finding graves after viewing group members

### Combined Workflow Example

**Scenario**: "Find all members of Smith Family group and visit each grave"

1. Go to Groups tab
2. Search for "Smith"
3. Click "Smith Family" group
4. All Smith family graves highlighted on map
5. Click on any highlighted grave
6. View grave information in modal
7. Click another Smith family member's name in the groups section
8. New grave's info appears
9. Click "Go To Location" to center map on that grave
10. Repeat to tour the entire family plot

## Technical Details

### Group Member Count Calculation

Uses `useMemo` to efficiently calculate counts:

```typescript
const groupMemberCounts = useMemo(() => {
  const counts = new Map<string, number>();
  const groups = cemeteryData.groups || [];
  const activeGraves = cemeteryData.graves.filter((g) => !g.properties.deleted);

  for (const group of groups) {
    if (group.properties.deleted) continue;
    const memberCount = activeGraves.filter((g) =>
      g.properties.group_ids?.includes(group.uuid)
    ).length;
    counts.set(group.uuid, memberCount);
  }

  return counts;
}, [cemeteryData]);
```

### Group Highlighting

Uses `useCallback` to memoize the handler:

```typescript
const handleGroupSelection = useCallback(async (group: Group) => {
  setSelectedGroup(group);
  const members = await getGravesByGroupId(group.uuid);
  const memberUuids = new Set(members.map((g) => g.uuid));
  setHighlightedGraves(memberUuids);
}, []);
```

### Map Centering

Imperatively calls MapGrid method:

```typescript
mapGridRef.current?.centerOn(gridPos.row, gridPos.col);
```

## UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Consistency

- Tabs match application color scheme
- Blue accent for active states
- Consistent spacing and borders
- Dark mode fully supported

### Responsive Design

- Sidebar works on all screen sizes
- Toggle button behavior preserved
- Tabs stack properly on mobile
- Touch-friendly tap targets

### Accessibility

- Semantic HTML (buttons, nav)
- ARIA labels where needed
- Keyboard navigation supported
- Color contrast maintained

## Performance Considerations

### Efficient Rendering

- `useMemo` for group member counts (recalculates only when data changes)
- `useCallback` for event handlers (prevents unnecessary re-renders)
- Conditional rendering of large lists
- Virtualization candidate for future (if >1000 groups)

### Optimal Data Access

- Single query for group members (`getGravesByGroupId`)
- Set-based highlighting (O(1) lookup)
- No redundant database calls
- Batch operations where possible

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Tests

- ✅ Switch between Graves and Groups tabs
- ✅ Search for groups by name
- ✅ Search for groups by description
- ✅ Sort groups by name (A-Z, Z-A)
- ✅ Sort groups by member count (ascending/descending)
- ✅ Select a group and verify highlighting
- ✅ View grave info and click "Go To Location"
- ✅ Map centers on correct cell
- ✅ Highlight appears and clears after 3 seconds
- ✅ Navigate between group members in modal
- ✅ Test with empty groups (0 members)
- ✅ Test with large groups (many members)
- ✅ Test on mobile viewport

### Edge Cases

- Empty cemetery (no groups)
- No groups in data file
- Groups with deleted members
- Graves in multiple groups
- Very long group names/descriptions
- Special characters in search

## Browser Compatibility

All features use standard browser APIs:

- CSS transforms (map centering)
- Flexbox (layout)
- Set data structure (highlighting)
- Promises (async operations)

Tested and working in:

- Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- Firefox
- Safari

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions

1. **Group color on map**: Option to color graves by group
2. **Multi-select groups**: Highlight multiple groups at once
3. **Group export**: Export list of group members to CSV
4. **Group statistics**: Show age ranges, date ranges, etc.
5. **Group map overlay**: Draw boundary around group members
6. **Quick filters**: Toggle specific groups on/off
7. **Group creation from list**: Create group and add multiple graves at once

## Migration Notes

### For Developers

- Import `TabbedList` instead of `GraveList` in CemeteryView
