4. Click to highlight all members
5. Navigate between family members
6. Document relationships in notes

## Performance Characteristics

### Data Access

- O(1) group lookup by UUID
- O(n) member count calculation (cached with useMemo)
- O(1) grave highlight lookup (Set-based)
- Single database query per group selection

### Rendering

- Memoized calculations prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Conditional rendering reduces DOM complexity
- Tab switching is instant (no data reload)
- Map highlighting uses existing mechanism

### Memory

- Groups stored in IndexedDB (persistent)
- Member counts calculated on demand
- Highlighted graves stored as Set (memory efficient)
- No memory leaks (cleanup on unmount)

## Browser Compatibility

✅ Chrome/Edge (Chromium)  
✅ Firefox  
✅ Safari  
✅ Mobile browsers

Uses standard APIs:

- IndexedDB
- CSS transforms
- Flexbox
- Promises
- Sets and Maps

## Testing Status

### Automated Tests

- ✅ TypeScript type checking passes
- ✅ ESLint passes (no errors)
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ All existing unit tests pass

### Manual Testing

- ✅ Group creation from grave editor
- ✅ Multi-group membership
- ✅ Tab switching in sidebar
- ✅ Group search and sort
- ✅ Group selection and highlighting
- ✅ Map centering on grave
- ✅ Navigation between group members
- ✅ Import/export with groups
- ✅ Backwards compatibility with old data
- ✅ Dark mode support
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness

### Edge Cases Tested

- ✅ Empty cemetery (no groups)
- ✅ Groups with no members
- ✅ Graves in multiple groups
- ✅ Very long group names
- ✅ Special characters in search
- ✅ Deleted groups and graves

## Migration Guide

### For Users

**No action required!**

- Open the app normally
- Database auto-upgrades to v4
- All existing data preserved
- New features available immediately
- Old data imports work perfectly

### For Developers

**Minimal changes needed:**

```typescript
// Old
import { GraveList } from '../components/GraveList';
<GraveList ... />

// New
import { TabbedList } from '../components/TabbedList';
<TabbedList
  graves={...}
  groups={...} // NEW
  groupMemberCounts={...} // NEW
  onSelectGroup={...} // NEW
  ...
/>
```

## Future Enhancement Ideas

### Near-term

- Group management page (edit/delete groups)
- Export group member list to CSV
- Group statistics (avg dates, ages, etc.)
- Filter graves by group in Graves tab

### Long-term

- Visual group boundaries on map
- Color graves by group membership
- Hierarchical groups (parent/child)
- Group templates and quick creation
- Bulk operations on group members
- Group-based access control

- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive documentation

## Conclusion

The groups feature is **complete and production-ready**. It provides:

✅ **Powerful Data Model**: Flexible multi-membership groups  
✅ **Rich UI**: Tabbed navigation, search, sort, highlight  
✅ **Map Integration**: Visual member highlighting  
✅ **Quick Navigation**: One-click location jumping  
✅ **Full Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and samples
