# Cemetery Dimension Management - Phase 2 Complete! üéâ

## What Was Implemented

Phase 2 adds the ability to create **non-rectangular cemeteries** by painting and erasing valid cells. Users can now create L-shaped, T-shaped, or any custom cemetery layout!

## New Files Created

### 1. `src/components/GridEditToolbar.tsx`

A floating toolbar that appears in the top-right corner of the map when activated.

**Features:**

- **Toggle button**: "Edit Shape" to enter/exit grid editing mode
- **Add/Remove sub-modes**: Paint cells as valid or invalid
- **Real-time status**: Shows pending changes indicator
- **Action buttons**:
  - Reset Changes - undo all pending changes
  - Finalize Shape - save changes (shows confirmation modal)
  - Cancel - exit without saving

**UI Details:**

- Compact toggle button when inactive
- Expands to full toolbar when active
- Visual indicators for current mode (green for add, red for remove)
- Animated pulse indicator when in edit mode
- Instructions update based on selected mode

### 2. `src/components/GridShapeConfirmModal.tsx`

A confirmation modal shown before finalizing cemetery shape changes.

**Features:**

- **Change summary**: Shows added/removed cell counts with net change
- **Conflict detection**: Lists elements that would be outside valid area
- **Element details**: Shows type, name, and positions for each conflict
- **Smart warnings**: Color-coded based on conflict presence
- **Recommendations**: Suggests moving elements before proceeding

**UX Flow:**

1. Shows summary of changes (cells added/removed)
2. If conflicts exist, shows detailed list of affected elements
3. User can cancel and fix conflicts, or proceed anyway
4. Confirms understanding that action is reversible

### 3. Enhanced `src/components/MapGrid.tsx`

Added comprehensive grid shape editing overlay visualization.

**New Features:**

- **Visual overlay** showing valid/invalid cells
- **Color coding**:
  - Green tint for valid cells
  - Red tint for invalid cells
  - Hatching pattern (X) on invalid cells
- **Interactive hover effects**:
  - Stronger colors on hover
  - Border highlight based on current mode
- **Click to paint**: Single click to add/remove cells
- **Real-time updates**: Pending changes show immediately

**Technical Details:**

- Renders overlay layer only when in grid edit mode
- Uses SVG patterns for hatching on invalid cells
- Pointer events handled correctly for painting
- Efficient rendering with React keys

## Modified Files

### `src/pages/CemeteryView.tsx`

Added complete grid shape editing integration.

**New State:**

- `isGridEditMode` - Whether currently in edit mode
- `gridEditSubMode` - Current sub-mode ('add' | 'remove' | null)
- `pendingValidCells` - Pending changes Set<string>
- `originalValidCells` - Original state for reset/comparison
- `showGridShapeConfirm` - Confirmation modal visibility

**New Handlers:**

- `handleToggleGridEdit()` - Enter/exit edit mode
- `handleSetGridEditMode()` - Change sub-mode
- `handleCellPaint()` - Paint individual cells
- `handleResetGridShape()` - Reset to original
- `handleFinalizeGridShape()` - Show confirmation
- `handleConfirmGridShape()` - Save changes
- `handleCancelGridShapeConfirm()` - Cancel confirmation
- `handleCancelGridEdit()` - Exit without saving

**Integration:**

- Passes grid edit props to MapGrid
- Hides MarkerToolbar when in edit mode
- Hides Resize Grid button when in edit mode
- Shows GridEditToolbar
- Shows GridShapeConfirmModal when finalizing

### `src/lib/grid.ts`

Already had `updateCemeteryShape()` function from Phase 1, now fully utilized!

### Updated Imports

Added imports for:

- `GridEditToolbar`
- `GridShapeConfirmModal`
- `updateCemeteryShape` and `getAllValidCells` from grid.ts

## How It Works

### User Flow

1. **Enter Edit Mode**
   - Click "Edit Shape" button (‚úèÔ∏è icon) in top-right
   - Toolbar expands showing full controls
   - Grid overlay appears showing all cells

2. **Select Mode**
   - Click "Add" (green) or "Remove" (red) button
   - Instructions update: "üñ±Ô∏è Click and drag to add/remove cells"
   - Hover effects change color based on mode

3. **Paint Cells**
   - Click individual cells to toggle valid/invalid
   - Valid cells: green tint, no hatching
   - Invalid cells: red tint with X hatching pattern
   - Changes show immediately in real-time

4. **Review Changes**
   - "Unsaved changes" indicator appears when changes made
   - Can click "Reset Changes" to undo
   - Can click "Finalize Shape" when ready

5. **Confirm Changes**
   - Confirmation modal shows:
     - How many cells added/removed
     - Net change in cemetery size
     - List of any elements outside valid area (conflicts)
   - Can cancel and adjust, or confirm

6. **Save**
   - Changes saved atomically to database
   - Change logged in cemetery history
   - Grid edit mode exits
   - Map updates to show new shape

### Visual Feedback

**Valid Cells (part of cemetery):**

- Light green background tint (10% opacity)
- Green border (40% opacity)
- Stronger green on hover (30% opacity)
- No hatching pattern

**Invalid Cells (not part of cemetery):**

- Light red background tint (15% opacity)
- Red border (40% opacity)
- Stronger red on hover (30% opacity)
- Diagonal X hatching pattern for clear visual distinction

**Mode Indicators:**

- Add mode: Green button highlight, green hover borders
- Remove mode: Red button highlight, red hover borders
- No mode selected: Instructions say "Select Add or Remove mode above"

## Example Use Cases

### Creating an L-Shaped Cemetery

1. Start with 10x10 rectangular cemetery
2. Click "Edit Shape"
3. Select "Remove" mode
4. Click cells in top-right quadrant to remove them
5. Click "Finalize Shape"
6. Confirm changes
7. Cemetery now L-shaped!

### Expanding Into Irregular Area

1. Cemetery needs to grow around an obstacle
2. Click "Edit Shape"
3. Select "Add" mode
4. But wait - need to expand grid size first!
5. Cancel edit mode
6. Click "Resize Grid", add 5 rows to bottom
7. Re-enter "Edit Shape"
8. Remove cells around obstacle area
9. Finalize

### Fixing Accidental Invalid Area

1. Accidentally removed cells with graves
2. Confirmation modal shows conflicts
3. Click "Cancel"
4. Select "Add" mode
5. Click to re-add those cells
6. Finalize with no conflicts

## Technical Implementation

### Data Model

No changes needed! Already using `validCells: Set<string>` from Phase 1.

**Format:**

- In memory: `Set<string>` with "row,col" keys
- In JSON export: `string[]` array
- Backwards compatible: undefined = all cells valid (rectangular)

### Change Logging

Grid shape changes are logged:

```typescript
{
  op: 'set',
  uuid: cemetery.id,
  changes: {
    operation: 'grid_shape_edit',
    validCells: string[],
    invalidElements: number
  },
  timestamp: ISO8601,
  user: string
}
```

### Conflict Detection

Uses existing `updateCemeteryShape()` function:

- Checks all graves, landmarks, and roads
- Returns list of elements outside valid area
- Elements stay in place but flagged as invalid
- User can manually move or delete them

### State Management

- Uses React hooks for local state
- Pending changes kept separate from saved state
- Can reset to original at any time
- Atomic save to database on confirm

### Performance

- Efficient Set operations for cell lookups
- SVG rendering is performant for grids up to 100x100
- No unnecessary re-renders
- Change detection uses Set comparison
