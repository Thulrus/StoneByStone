# Pre-commit Setup - Implementation Notes

## Date: October 4, 2025

## Overview

Added comprehensive pre-commit hook setup to ensure code quality and consistency across the project.

## Changes Made

### Dependencies Added

- `husky@9.1.7` - Git hooks management
- `lint-staged@16.2.3` - Run tasks on staged files

### Configuration Files Created

1. `.husky/pre-commit` - Pre-commit hook that runs:
   - lint-staged (ESLint + Prettier on staged files)
   - TypeScript type checking
   - Jest test suite

2. `lint-staged` config in `package.json`:
   - Auto-fixes ESLint issues on `.ts` and `.tsx` files
   - Formats `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.css`, `.json`, and `.md` files with Prettier

### Scripts Added

- `format:check` - Check formatting without modifying files
- `prepare` - Husky initialization (runs automatically after `npm install`)

### Documentation Created

- `docs/PRE_COMMIT_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup and troubleshooting guide
- `docs/PRE_COMMIT_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation summary and reference
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines with code style and workflow
- `SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Quick reference for new contributors
- `setup.sh` - One-command setup script for fresh clones

### Documentation Updated

- `README.md` - Added Quick Start section with setup instructions
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Updated "Before Committing" section

## How It Works

### For Existing Contributors

The next `git pull` + `npm install` will automatically set up the hooks via the `prepare` script.

### For New Contributors

Two options:

1. Run `./setup.sh` for automated setup
2. Run `npm install` (hooks set up automatically)

### Pre-commit Workflow

```
git commit
  ↓
Pre-commit hook runs:
  1. lint-staged (fast - only staged files)
  2. Type checking (full project)
  3. Tests (full suite)
  ↓
All pass? → Commit succeeds
Any fail? → Commit aborted with error messages
```

## Testing

### Verified

- ✅ Hooks directory created in `.husky/`
- ✅ Pre-commit script is executable
- ✅ `lint-staged` config in `package.json`
- ✅ All documentation formatted with Prettier
- ✅ Setup script is executable

### To Test Locally

```bash
# Make a small change
echo "// test" >> src/lib/user.ts

# Stage and try to commit
git add src/lib/user.ts
git commit -m "test: verify pre-commit hooks"

# Hooks should run automatically
# If successful, reset:
git reset HEAD~1
git restore src/lib/user.ts
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency** - All code follows the same style and standards
2. **Early Error Detection** - Issues caught before push/PR
3. **Automated Formatting** - No manual formatting needed
4. **Fast Feedback** - lint-staged only processes staged files
5. **Easy Onboarding** - One command setup for new contributors

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:

1. **Selective Testing** - Run only tests related to changed files
2. **Commit Message Linting** - Add commitlint for conventional commits
3. **Branch Protection** - Add pre-push hooks for additional checks
4. **CI/CD Integration** - Ensure same checks run in CI
5. **Performance Tuning** - If pre-commit is too slow, adjust checks

## Notes

- Node.js 18+ recommended (some warnings on 18.x are safe to ignore)
- Hooks can be bypassed with `--no-verify` flag (not recommended)
- All checks also run in CI/CD for safety
- Documentation emphasizes these are safeguards, not obstacles

## Related Issues

- Addresses code consistency across contributors
- Prevents common mistakes before they reach CI/CD
- Reduces review time by catching issues early

## Rollback Procedure

If needed, to remove pre-commit hooks:

```bash
# Remove hooks
rm -rf .husky

# Remove dependencies
npm uninstall husky lint-staged

# Restore package.json
git restore package.json package-lock.json
```

## Acknowledgments

- Uses industry-standard tools (Husky, lint-staged)
- Follows best practices from popular open-source projects
- Documentation inspired by React, Vue, and other major projects
