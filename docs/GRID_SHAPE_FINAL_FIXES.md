# Grid Shape Editing - Final Fixes

## Changes Made

This document describes the final fixes applied to the grid shape editing feature based on user feedback.

### Issues Fixed

1. **Invalid cells appearance**: Changed from gray with X hatching to solid black
2. **Accidental toggle on drag**: Fixed cells being toggled when starting a drag to pan
3. **Element placement validation**: Prevented placing elements on invalid cells
4. **Deleted elements in conflicts**: Excluded deleted graves/landmarks/roads from conflict detection

---

## 1. Invalid Cells Appearance

**Issue**: Invalid cells (outside cemetery boundaries) showed as gray with diagonal X hatching, which wasn't visually clear enough.

**Solution**: Changed to solid black background for maximum visibility.

### File: `src/components/MapGrid.tsx`

**Before**:

```typescript
<rect
  fill="rgba(156, 163, 175, 0.2)"
  stroke="rgba(156, 163, 175, 0.3)"
/>
{/* Hatching pattern lines */}
```

**After**:

```typescript
<rect
  fill="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)"
  pointerEvents="none"
/>
```

**Visual Result**: Invalid cells now appear as solid black squares, making it immediately obvious which areas are not part of the cemetery.

## 2. Accidental Toggle on Drag

**Issue**: When clicking and dragging to pan the map in "Edit Shape" mode, the cell where the mouse was pressed would toggle on/off, even though the user was just trying to pan.

**Solution**: Added drag distance detection to the grid edit overlay's click handler. Only toggles if mouse moved less than 5 pixels.

### File: `src/components/MapGrid.tsx`

**Updated Click Handler**:

```typescript
onClick={(e) => {
  e.stopPropagation();
  // Only toggle if we didn't drag (mouse didn't move significantly)
  if (mouseDownPos) {
    const dragDistance = Math.sqrt(
      Math.pow(e.clientX - mouseDownPos.x, 2) +
        Math.pow(e.clientY - mouseDownPos.y, 2)
    );
    // If mouse moved less than 5 pixels, treat it as a click
    if (dragDistance < 5) {
      onCellPaint?.({ row, col });
    }
  }
}}
```

**How It Works**:

- Records mouse position on `mouseDown`
- On `click`, calculates distance traveled
- Only triggers toggle if distance < 5 pixels
- Dragging the map no longer accidentally toggles cells

---

## 3. Element Placement Validation

**Issue**: Users could place graves, landmarks, and roads on invalid cells (outside cemetery boundaries).

**Solution**: Added validation check in `handleCellClick` to prevent placement on invalid cells using the `isCellValid()` function.

### File: `src/pages/CemeteryView.tsx`

**Import Added**:

```typescript
import {
  resizeGrid,
  updateCemeteryShape,
  getAllValidCells,
  isCellValid,
} from '../lib/grid';
```

**Validation Added**:

```typescript
const handleCellClick = (position: GridPosition) => {
  if (!activeMarkerType || !cemeteryData) return;

  // Check if the cell is valid (part of the cemetery)
  if (!isCellValid(cemeteryData.cemetery, position)) {
    // Optionally show a message to the user
    console.warn('Cannot place element on invalid cell:', position);
    return;
  }

  // Continue with placement logic...
```

**Effect**:

- Clicking on black (invalid) cells does nothing
- Only valid cells allow element placement
- Works for graves, landmarks, and roads
- Prevents data corruption from out-of-bounds elements

## 4. Deleted Elements in Conflicts

**Issue**: When finalizing a cemetery shape or resizing the grid, deleted elements (with `deleted: true` flag) were still being reported as conflicts, confusing users.

**Solution**: Filter out deleted elements before checking for conflicts in both `updateCemeteryShape()` and `resizeGrid()` functions.

### File: `src/lib/grid.ts`

#### updateCemeteryShape Function

**Before**:

```typescript
graves.forEach((grave) => {
  const key = `${grave.grid.row},${grave.grid.col}`;
  if (!validCells.has(key)) {
    invalidElements.push({...});
  }
});
```

**After**:

```typescript
graves
  .filter((grave) => !grave.properties.deleted)
  .forEach((grave) => {
    const key = `${grave.grid.row},${grave.grid.col}`;
    if (!validCells.has(key)) {
      invalidElements.push({...});
    }
  });
```

Same filtering applied to:

- Landmarks
- Roads

#### resizeGrid Function

**Updated Conflict Detection**:

```typescript
// Check for conflicts (but don't report deleted graves)
if (
  !grave.properties.deleted &&
  (wouldBeOutOfBounds(grave.grid, direction, count, newRows, newCols) ||
    newPosition.row < 0 ||
    newPosition.col < 0)
) {
  conflicts.push({...});
}
```

Same logic applied to:

- Landmarks
- Roads

**Effect**:

- Deleted elements no longer appear in conflict lists
- Conflict modals only show active elements
- Reduces user confusion
- Allows soft-deleted elements to remain in database without affecting operations

## Visual Examples

### Invalid Cells Display

**Before**: Gray with X pattern (subtle)

```
┌─────┬─────┐
│ ╱╲  │     │  Gray with diagonal lines
│╱  ╲ │     │
└─────┴─────┘
```

**After**: Solid black (obvious)

```
┌─────┬─────┐
│█████│     │  Solid black
│█████│     │
└─────┴─────┘
```

### Cemetery Shape Examples

Valid shapes that now work correctly:

**L-Shaped Cemetery**:

```
██████████████
██████████████
██████
██████
██████
```

**T-Shaped Cemetery**:

```
     ██████
     ██████
███████████████
███████████████
```

**U-Shaped Cemetery**:

```
██████    ██████
██████    ██████
██████    ██████
███████████████
███████████████
```

Black areas (█) are **not** part of the cemetery.

## Implementation Details

### Drag Distance Calculation

Uses Euclidean distance formula:

```typescript
distance = √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²)
```

Threshold: 5 pixels

- Less than 5px = Click → Toggle cell
- 5px or more = Drag → Pan map

### Cell Validation Function

The `isCellValid()` function from `src/lib/grid.ts`:

```typescript
export function isCellValid(
  cemetery: Cemetery,
  position: GridPosition
): boolean {
  // Check bounds first
  if (
    position.row < 0 ||
    position.row >= cemetery.grid.rows ||
    position.col < 0 ||
    position.col >= cemetery.grid.cols
  ) {
    return false;
  }

  // If no validCells set, all cells within bounds are valid (rectangular grid)
  if (!cemetery.grid.validCells || cemetery.grid.validCells.size === 0) {
    return true;
  }

  // Check if cell is in validCells set
  const key = `${position.row},${position.col}`;
  return cemetery.grid.validCells.has(key);
}
```

Checks:

1. Within grid bounds (row/col >= 0 and < max)
2. If no custom shape, all cells valid (backward compatible)
3. If custom shape exists, check Set membership

## User Experience Improvements

### Before These Fixes

❌ Invalid cells were subtle (gray with X)
❌ Dragging to pan accidentally toggled cells
❌ Could place graves on invalid cells → data corruption
❌ Deleted graves showed as conflicts → confusion

### After These Fixes

✅ Invalid cells are obvious (solid black)
✅ Dragging to pan works smoothly without toggling cells
✅ Cannot place elements on invalid cells → data integrity
✅ Only active elements show as conflicts → clarity

---

## Backward Compatibility

All changes maintain backward compatibility:

- ✅ Existing rectangular cemeteries work unchanged
- ✅ Cemeteries without `validCells` treat all cells as valid
- ✅ Deleted elements still stored in database
- ✅ Import/export unchanged
- ✅ Change log unchanged

---

## Next Steps

Users should now be able to:

1. Create custom cemetery shapes confidently
2. Pan the map smoothly while editing
3. Place elements only on valid cemetery areas
4. See clear visual distinction between valid/invalid areas
5. Delete graves without affecting grid operations

The grid shape editing feature is now production-ready! 🎉
