# Near Future

- Changeable cemetery size. need to be able to add/remove columns/rows on any side.
- Need markers for landmarks (entrance, tree, statue, streets, etc.)
- Bring more attention to the grave location when a name is selected
- Options for sorting the list. Alphabetical (by last name?), by row, by column, anything else that seems cool.
- Improve the system that allows you to open a new cemetery. Each cemetery should have its own uuid, and we only try to merge if the UUIDs match.
