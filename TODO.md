# Near Future

- Improve what happens if we have conflicting graves when we merge. Right now it just displays two graves and makes them red, but when you click on them it just brings one up. We want it to bring up some kind of merge resolve window that allows us to choose which data to keep.
- Only give the option to merge data if the cemetery ID is the same.
- Add button to edit sidebar that lets you move an element with a click on a new square. When you click it, it closes everything except the map, highlights the current location, then when you click the new location, it changes the value in the edit sidebar and shows the icon in the new location. If you cancel, it goes back to where it was. If you save, it's permanent.
- Make the toolbar better
