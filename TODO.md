# Near Future

- Changeable cemetery size. need to be able to add/remove columns/rows on any side.
- Abnormally sized cemeteries where we can mask out sections as not being part of the cemetery.
- Bring more attention to the grave location when a name is selected
- Options for sorting the list. Alphabetical (by last name?), by row, by column, anything else that seems cool.
- Improve what happens if we have conflicting graves when we merge. Right now it just displays two graves and makes them red, but when you click on them it just brings one up. We want it to bring up some kind of merge resolve window that allows us to choose which data to keep.
- Change the things that asks you your name in order to track changes so that it only asks you when you try to save a change.
- Maybe set it up so that when you click existing stuff it opens the info in a view mode, and then if you want to edit it, you click an edit button. that would make maps for navigation away cleaner.
